Principals of Computer System Design (PCSD) :

Developed  an  integration  broker  abstraction  in  a  simplified  order  processing 
scenario. The task was implemented in Java,  compatible with JDK 6. Jetty was used 
as  an  RPC  mechanism.  For  the  completion  of  the  project  all  the  following  aspects 
were encountered:

Design of transactional and distributed system.


Enforce modularity through a client-service abstraction.

Concurrency control and recovery, as well as for distribution and replication.

Implementation of a system that includes mechanisms for modularity, atomicity,and fault tolerance.

Structure and conduct experiments to evaluate a system's performance.

Explain techniques for large-scale data processing.

Apply principles of large-scale data processing to concrete problems.
